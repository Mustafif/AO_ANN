In our model we handle the dataset loading using the `OptionDataset` class. This class
accepts a `dataframe` from the `pandas` library, and will prepare the base, engineered features, and target variable.
When used in the model, it also has the methods `__len__` and `__getitem__`.

We also make use of two helper functions: `dataset_file` which just returns the `dataframe` from `pandas.read_csv`, and `dataset_dir` which returns the directory path to the dataset.
and `cleandataset` which cleans the dataset by removing any entries where the option price is less than $0.5.

With these two helper functions, the typical usage is as follows:

```python
from ao_ann import OptionDataset, cleandataset, dataset_file
dataset = cleandataset(dataset_file("foo.csv"))
option_dataset = OptionDataset(dataset)
```

However, if you are handling a dataset and want to automatically clean it, split the
dataset into training and testing sets you can use the `DS` class.

```python
from ao_ann import DS
train, test = DS(csv_path, None, name).datasets()
```

This is the recommended method for handling datasets in the `ao_ann` package.
