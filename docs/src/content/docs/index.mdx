<Card title="Neural Network American Option Pricing">
    The `ao_ann` package provides a neural network implementation for pricing American options under a GARCH process.
    This model is built using the `torch` library and features classes for loading the data from CSV files, and
    a main entry point for training, evaluating and saving results and the model itself.
